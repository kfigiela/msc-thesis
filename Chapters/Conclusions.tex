\section{Conclusions}

The results presented in this thesis illustrate typical problems when making decisions on deployment planning on clouds and how they can be addressed using optimization techniques. After exploring existing solutions, we have shown how the mixed integer nonlinear programming can be applied to model and solve the problem of resource allocation on multiple heterogeneous clouds, including private and public ones, and taking into account the cost of compute instances and data transfers. The formulated models were evaluated then in terms of results, performance and solution stability.

\section{Future work}

Future work could possibly include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Perform experiments on real cloud infrastructure.
  \item Extending application and infrastructure models.
  \item Adding heuristics to the optimization models to improve performance.
  \item Performance tuning of the workflow model.
\end{itemize}
